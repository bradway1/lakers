##Purpose:
“Grade-book” is a Desktop Application that will perform all the mathematical calculations needed to find out the standard deviation, average, and minimum scores for a classroom. It will have more features available such as displaying statistical information on a per student basis and display data on graphs. The backbone data will be stored in an SQL Database. This Desktop Application will be driven by a simple, easy to use, and intuitive UserInterface.
